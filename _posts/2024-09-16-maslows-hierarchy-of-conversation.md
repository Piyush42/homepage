Maslow's Hierarchy of Conversation
Maslow is credited as a brilliant psychologist, but he also gave us the hierarchy of topics we talk about, depending on the number of people in the conversation and the shared vulnerability.
The Trivia Night Revelation
"What is the Latin word for a place where three roads meet?" This was the first trivia question we had in our tipsy-trivia game night we hosted a few years back. The answer to that trivia, and how Maslow would have been a great conversationalist is explored below. Let's dive in.
I love hosting friends at home for trivia or board game nights. If you ever want to test your persuasion (or deception) skills— play Avalon with your friends. We did, and we lost many games, and a few friends for a night. When mulling over my losses, I learned that I love playing Avalon with one group of friends, and with others, we enjoy our company in smaller groups or even 1:1.
The Dynamics of Group Conversations
Why is it that there are some friends with whom you can never hold a long conversation one-on-one and yet enjoy their company in a big group? And why do some shine in a smaller setting but hate to be in a big group? I found the answer in my university psychology class notes—Maslow.
Maslow's Hierarchy: From Needs to Conversations
As many of you might already be familiar, Maslow's hierarchy of needs is a theory in psychology outlining human needs, starting with the most basic physiological needs and moving up to self-actualization. It is represented as a pyramid with five levels: physiological needs, safety needs, love and belonging, esteem, and self-actualization.
Now, instead of a hierarchy of needs, what if we see it as a hierarchy of topics of conversation?
The Conversation Pyramid

Big Groups (8+ people): Conversation in a big group of eight or more people will be about food, sex, or if you're unlucky, weather. Basic needs.
Medium Groups (3-5 people): In a smaller group of three to five, you can slowly unmask and reveal a bit about what ticks you off in your relationship, that unfulfilled ambition of being a YouTuber, that sense of pride in finally getting that handstand right. Smaller groups have comfortable silences.
One-on-One: Finally, you're alone with your close friend, or that tier-one friend. When you're alone with them, your insecurities come out. They have seen you at your worst and still held your hand. They laugh at your bookmarked Instagram reels that only you two would find funny. They are your WhatsApp chat where you can send your grocery list as a reminder only for yourself. Only with them, you can't be cancelled.

The Vulnerability Factor
More people means more pull, and the conversation goes to the lowest level of hierarchy of topics. It also boils down to our shared vulnerability. It can be overwhelming to be vulnerable—there's a rise of therapy because it gives you the safe space to be you.
More shared vulnerability, and your conversation topics ascend to higher topics. Like about how our parents might have been happier with way less, how much our childhood shaped us, and how we can probably never buy a house.
Why It's Important
Our environment shapes us, and it helps to be actively conscious about how we want to be shaped. Every friend has a place. It'd be oddly terrifying to be with the friend who's always deep, or on the other hand, to be with a friend who seeks the solution to every problem in that next drink.
I often ask myself if I have a group of friends who can distract me without asking about my life? Yes, sir. And do I also have friends who don't need their phone or alcohol to talk for hours about how they almost got a nose surgery due to their insecurities, how they can't keep their smart garden alive so they can't even imagine having a kid, or how they're dealing with depression—just being imperfect?
Luckily, I do. And we often play Avalon, too.
And you? (asking for a friend).
